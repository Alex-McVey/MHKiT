Tidal Module
---------------

The tidal module contains a set of functions to calculate relevant 
quantities of interest for tidal energy converters (TEC). The tool 
provides functionality to request data from NOAA curent bouys or 
the user may bring their own data. From the current data the user may


The tidal module contains the following submodules:

* ``io``: Loads data from NOAA currents
* ``resource``: Computes resource metrics such as exceedance probability and principal directions of flow
* ``device``: Computes device metrics such as equivalent diameter and capture area
* ``graphics``: Generates graphics such as rose plots, and joint probability distributions

See :ref:`MHKiT-Python <python>` or :ref:`MHKiT-Matlab <matlab>` for more details on the river module.
