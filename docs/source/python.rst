MHKiT-Python includes continuous integration software tests and documentation builds that are run using a GitLab CI pipeline. 
The tests are run and documentation is rebuilt each time changes are made to the repository. 
The tests are designed to ensure that the code is performing as expected. 
New tests and documentation are developed each time new functions are added or modified.
Testing status (passing/failed) and code coverage statistics are posted on the `README page <https://github.com/MHKiT-Code-Hub/MHKiT-Python>`_.
Results from the software tests and documentation builds can be viewed at `Pipeline page <https://code.primre.org/mhkit/mhkit-python/pipelines>`_.
Tests can also be run locally using the Python package nose, and 
documentation can be build locally using the Python package Sphinx.
