MHKiT (Marine and Hydrokinetic Toolkit)
######################################################
`MHKiT (Marine and Hydrokinetic Toolkit) <https://github.com/MHKiT-Code-Hub>`_ is a collection of open-source marine renewable energy toolboxes developed in Python/Matlab for ingesting, quality controlling, processing, visualizing, and managing data. MHKiT Python/Matlab provides robust and verified functions in both Python and Matlab that are needed by the 
MRE community and are not otherwise available. Calculations and visualizations adhere to IEC technical specifications and other guidelines. Current 
toolboxes include power performance, power quality, mechanical loads, resource tools, and data QC for wave, tidal, and river applications.
