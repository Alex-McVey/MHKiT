MHKiT (Marine and Hydrokinetic Toolkit)
######################################################
`MHKiT (Marine and Hydrokinetic Toolkit) <https://github.com/MHKiT-Code-Hub>`_ is a collection of open-source marine renewable energy (MRE) software modules developed in Python and MATLAB for ingesting, quality controlling, processing, visualizing, and managing data. MHKiT-Python and MHKiT-MATLAB provides robust and verified functions in both Python and MATLAB that are needed by the 
MRE community to standardize data processing. Calculations and visualizations adhere to IEC technical specifications and other guidelines. Current 
functionality includes power performance, power quality, mechanical loads, resource tools, and data quality control for wave, tidal, and river applications.
