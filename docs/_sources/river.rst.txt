* ``resource``: Computes resource metrics such as exceedance probability, velocity, and power
* ``device``: Computes device metrics such as equivalent diameter and capture area
* ``graphics``: Generates graphics

See :ref:`MHKiT-Python <python>` or :ref:`MHKiT-Matlab <matlab>` for more details on the river module.
