Wave Module
------------

The wave module contains a set of functions to
calculate quantities of interest for wave energy converters (WEC). 

The wave module contains the following submodules:

* ``io``: Loads data from standard formats
* ``resource``: Computes resource metrics such as spectra and significant wave height
* ``performance``: Computes performance metrics such as capture length matrix and mean annual energy production
* ``graphics``: Generates graphics

See :ref:`MHKiT-Python <python>` or :ref:`MHKiT-Matlab <matlab>` for more details on the wave module.
